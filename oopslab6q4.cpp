/*4.Write a program in C++ to create a class "library" having total no. of books and department name
as its member. Create another class "student" which stores student details like name, roll no, 
section , year of admission. These above two classes are derived from a class "university" which is 
having university name, total strength of student as its private member. Input all the details and 
display using user defined member function?*/
